### Creator Growth Model

What role will creators and influencers play in the growth of EarnOS?

Our Creator Network, which consists of over 750M user reach, are encouraged to share and promote the EarnOS platform on an on-going basis due to the aforementioned aligned referral program.

Additionally, the EarnOS platform gives Creators more direct access to their followers and increased ownership compared to third party platforms.

The off-the-shelf loyalty platform is designed to identify, engage, promote and utilise a creator's top followers and advocates. This program only unlocks when the Creator continues to share and promote EarnOS. This aligns the goals of EarnOS with the goals of our creator network, promoting:

1. Gamification on platform through Creator specific leaderboards
2. Easy identification of creator advocates who can boost creator reach and virality
3. Increased engagement and following across existing and new social channels.

Creators also receive a 9% share of revenue paid monthly for every partner they introduce. This allows EarnOS to access the brands that creators have previously worked with and would want to work with again.

Finally, due to users only being able to be attributed to one referrer, there is an incentive for all creators to join EarnOS early and promote the platform to ensure that followers are associated with them, rather than other creators and influencers that may share the same followers.

### Partner Growth Model

What role will partners play in the growth of EarnOS?

Partners are encouraged to bring their existing database(s) into EarnOS when they commence their missions and open their community. This approach provided increased success of both the Partner mission and the overall growth of the EarnOS platform.

Partners are also encouraged to share EarnOS missions and communities on their existing social channels. Due to the nature of the brands and partners EarnOS will attract, this will, alongside our Creator model, significantly boost the exposure and recognition of EarnOS globally.

Partners may also be able to benefit from the referral program in the future. This would offset the EarnOS fee when Partners introduce new people to EarnOS.

### Agency Growth Model

What role will agencies play in the growth of EarnOS?

Agencies are incentivized to bring their existing customers onto EarnOS and allocate growth spending as they receive up to 9% of the EarnOS Partner fee through the Agency Reward program.

Agencies are constantly seeking a point of difference in a space where there are few options. The average cost of acquisition is increasing whilst the effectiveness of existing solutions is decreasing. Recent regulatory changes have rendered existing approaches to user advertising ineffective due to GDPR requirements. This has forced agencies to actively seek out solutions such as EarnOS.

Agencies often are the aggregation point of total spend for a brand and many represent dozens of brands. This allows EarnOS to establish a faster rate of adoption and onboard more partners than only approaching brands individually.

### User Growth Model

How will EarnOS attract its first million users?

1. EarnOS has partnered with over 500 influencers and agencies to provide exposure to over 750M people.
2. EarnOS has attracted launch Partners with over 100M reach through their social platforms.
3. EarnOS has developed a unique and highly rewarding virality program that rewards all members of the community on an ongoing basis.
4. EarnOS has developed a Bring-your-Own-Data campaign that encourages our Partners to invite their existing customer base into the EarnOS community that enables EarnOS to leverage the totality of our Partner's existing customers

This multi-pronged approach will deliver substantial and ongoing user growth for EarnOS.

### EarnOS Growth Case Studies

How has EarnOS progressed so far?

1. **Online Gaming Company - Direct**
   - Onboarded founding Partner brand who committed to $10,000 - $90,000/monthly spend as EarnOS scales. The Partner can invite their own existing community into EarnOS, earning referral rewards and thus reduce the cost of running missions on the platform while growing the EarnOS community.
2. **Digital Marketing Agencies - In-Direct**
   - Onboardered US based Digital Agency who manages 15-25 Fortune 1000 brands. Agency will run paid and unpaid campaigns with 3-5 of the brands they manage for launch and will introduce further Brands based on performance. The agency will enjoy 9% of EarnOS fee for every Brand they introduce, paid monthly for the lifetime of the Partner spend.
3. **Creator Partners Referrals - Revenue Share**
   - Large, Gaming Focused Influencer introduces a gaming software company to EarnOS due to a close working relationship they have built over the years. For the introduction, they earn 9% of the EarnOS fee for that introduced brand, paid monthly for the lifetime of the Partner spend alongside the ongoing referral earn they get for every user they introduce into EarnOS.

**How is our growth model zero cost and sustainable?**

EarnOS grows alongside the success of our partner brands and leverages the networks of each and every one of our members. EarnOS only pays those helping us grow when EarnOS itself has been paid a fee for the positive outcome of our marketplace. This means everyone wins.
