### Introduction

Web2 hailed ads and social networks as winners, given the eyeball-exposure equation. But trouble brewed: value clustered, treating folks as mere commodities.

Add to that soaring customer acquisition costs and fading digital ad punch.

Meet EarnOS. With our audacious Cost Per Result (CPR) model—brands only pay for actual growth. Users? Rewarded for their time and encouraged to build communities.

### Revenue

How does the company make money?

Every time a mission is completed on the platform, EarnOS charges the Partner a success fee. This fee is charged separately to the reward which is paid out to the members for completing a mission.
