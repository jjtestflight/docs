## title: Introduction to EarnOS

### Introduction

Please note, the focus of this documentation is to introduce the EarnOS application, however to do so, we must first talk to the underlying protocol powering EarnOS and future ecosystem applications, OpenSystem (OS).

Detailed documentation around the OS protocol will be publicly available closer to mainnet launch.

OpenSystem is an omni-chain Layer2 payments orchestration protocol. EarnOS is the first ecosystem application powered by OS.

Web2 unlocked the ability for any business to receive credit card payments. Stripe built the infrastructure to make it easy for businesses to move into e-commerce, unlocking trillions in value creation.

Web3 unlocked the possibility for everyone to pay everyone. However, we need solutions that make complex payment scenarios easier for enterprises including:

- One to many payments (marketplaces)
- Scheduled payments (gig-economy) and;
- Complex payout management (creator economy, referral platforms).

OpenSystem (OS) is building the Layer2 payments orchestration infrastructure that will power a suite of L3 applications allowing any form of complex payment orchestration across any industrial vertical.

We believe in a customer centric approach to accelerate the adoption and make transacting easier for enterprises. We must solve their problems with laser focus. To demonstrate and validate the application of this new form of payment orchestration, we started with our first use case… the $1T Digital Advertising industry. Enter, EarnOS.

EarnOS allows companies and brands to directly reward users for engagement paid in USDC. EarnOS is our first application that is powered by the OS Payment Orchestration Protocol ($OS)

Monetising consumers is hard, so we built a marketplace that monetises massive brands and companies and rewards consumers directly instead. We've quickly amassed amazing traction with 35+ global brand partners signed on, including BMW, Uber, Sunglasshut and Basket & Robins - committing to 6M USD + GMV committed spend on the platform pre-launch, with access to additional 200M USD+ already unlocked through our agency partners.

With Web3 + OS, complex payment orchestration is now accessible to any enterprise.


### EarnOS Future Thesis

In the near future, digital smart wallets (Web3) will go from a novel solution to an integrated default. iOS and Android will ship it natively within their mobile operating systems and the adoption curve will no longer be a curve, but a summit.

5 billion smart phones will become 5 billion wallets and 5 billion people will be able to natively interact with each and every platform that has been built on Web3.
When that day comes, every company on earth will benefit from being able to interact with every consumer on earth directly.

EarnOS is building that platform.

EarnOS allows brands to connect directly with people, reward them for their time and participation and eliminate complexity.

EarnOS is building the future of payment and social orchestration. We are a Web3 powered platform that automates the assignment, verification and payment of digital tasks to people and communities.

Help us build the new digital economy.

### What is EarnOS?

What is EarnOS in under 60 seconds?

EarnOS is a Web3 powered Global Ad & Payments Platform where everybody wins.

A growth ecosystem that connects brands to customers by offering missions that benefit the brand and rewards that benefit the users.

Brands pay to run missions that help them gain exposure, community and customers.

Users complete missions that help them learn about brands, join new communities and get rewarded.

### Introduction

Web2 hailed ads and social networks as winners, given the eyeball-exposure equation. But trouble brewed: value clustered, treating folks as mere commodities.

Add to that soaring customer acquisition costs and fading digital ad punch.

Enter Web3, enabling instant wallets & payments, sparking a novel growth approach valuing time and attention.

Meet EarnOS. With our audacious Cost Per Result (CPR) model—brands only pay for actual growth. Users? Rewarded for their time and encouraged to build communities.

The natural progression down the value chain. From Cost Per Impression, to Cost Per Click and now Cost Per Result.

Web3 makes it real—a previously unobtainable feat achieved.

Embrace EarnOS: Brands pay for results, users are rewarded for their time and creators for their reach, fuelling genuine resonance.

In the realm of EarnOS, growth thrives.

### How EarnOS works

A brief overview of the typical function of the platform.

**High Level Overview:**

1. People join EarnOS and create their digital wallet in seconds.
2. Creating a wallet for everyone is effortless.
3. People browse through different communities and opportunities to find things that resonate with them.
4. They join communities and learn more about the various brands, products and services associated with those communities.
5. They complete missions associated with different Brands and earn rewards every time they do so.
6. They invite their friends onto the platform and are rewarded every time those friends complete missions.

**Detailed Walkthrough:**

1. A person, Seth, sees a friend share that they recently got rewarded 5 USD by BMW for watching their latest BMW Electric video and sharing it with their friends.
2. They click the link, and see the various opportunities on EarnOS that are available in the form of Missions. They checkout the rewards available per mission.
3. They decide to sign up.
4. They don’t have a digital wallet and create one in a few seconds.
5. They then connect their Google account, Twitter account and WhatsApp.
6. They are asked to select from a range of Brands that they like so they can join some communities to get started.
7. They proceed to the Dashboard where they select a mission for Robinhood to download their trading app and get 25 USD to start trading with. They will also earn 5 USD in rewards on the EarnOS platform when they complete the mission.
8. The first task to complete is to join the Robinhood community.
9. The second task is to follow Robinhood on Twitter, Instagram and/or Tiktok.
10. The third task is to download Robinhood and enter their account number into EarnOS.
11. The final task is to share a Post on two of either Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/Tiktok to your followers that you have just signed up to Robinhood using EarnOS and got rewarded 5 USD.
12. Seth has completed all required tasks for this mission.
13. Seth then clicks Verify to confirm his tasks have been completed.
14. The EarnOS Verification Engine verifies that the tasks have been completed on each platform.
15. All tasks verify successfully, and as Seth verified his account already, his reward is immediately deposited into the digital wallet he created just minutes ago.
16. Seth is returned to the dashboard to explore other opportunities and communities.
17. They join a few Partner communities that resonate with them that they’ve been meaning to check out.
18. Seth can’t believe he just got rewarded 5 USD just for discovering a new product.
19. Seth browses to his profile and notices that he can also invite his friends to EarnOS and get rewarded every time they complete missions like he just did.
20. Seth invites a few friends across his WhatsApp chats and let’s them know how easy it is.
21. Process repeats to infinity.

### Revenue

How does the company make money?

Every time a mission is completed on the platform, EarnOS charges the Partner a success fee. This fee is charged separately to the reward which is paid out to the members for completing a mission.

EarnOS will attract many partners over time who will conduct millions of missions each, resulting in billions of dollars in rewards and EarnOS will charge a fee for every single one.

**Example:**

Estimated Partners: 3000

Estimated Total Missions over 12 Months: 192,000,000 USD

EarnOS Revenue (1 USD per mission): 192,000,000 USD
