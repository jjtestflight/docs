### Key Points of Difference

What are the key points of difference that separate us from existing solutions, both new and old.

**High Level Comparison**

A typical mission on the EarnOS platform is designed to allow a Partner to accomplish:

1. User Acquisition
2. Community Building
3. Product/Service Awareness
4. Social Reach and Impression
5. Expanded Top Funnel
6. Social Follower growth
7. Brand Recognition

Competing products offer just one or two of the above in an optimal scenario.

**Detailed Comparison**

1. **EarnOS vs Cost Per Click/Impression**
   1. CPC doesn’t always lead to an outcome, but always leads to a cost.
   2. EarnOS only costs Partners when a mission is completed and the specified tasks have been verified.
   3. CPC often incurs substantial costs attributed to Bots and non-human views/clicks.
   4. **EarnOS only has verified humans as members on our platform**. **No bots.**
   5. CPC doesn’t provide Brands with organic virality and additional value add such as growth of social properties and new users sharing their onboarding story with their followers.
2. **EarnOS vs Paid Creator Sponsorship**
   1. Paid Creator Sponsorship campaigns can reduce brand integrity and have diminished percentage reach when compared to organic social shares.
   2. EarnOS utilises organic reach through its mission structures, resulting in thousands of genuine shares, providing exposure/impressions to countless people alongside the other outcomes from the partner missions.
   3. Creators often have a substantial portion of their followers as bots/non-human users, leading to incorrect impressions and exposure metrics.
   4. EarnOS only has verified humans as members on our platform. No bots.
3. **EarnOS vs Paid Social Exposure**
   1. Paid Sponsored posts are often subconsciously ignored and/or filtered by Adblockers
   1. Paid posts are considered less authentic than user posts
   1. EarnOS encourages/requires members to share their partner journey organically to their followers. This provides broad, authentic reach for Partners by harnessing the organic, distributed network of the EarnOS member community.
   1. Paid Social Exposure often is expanding reach to a significant number of bots/non-human users, leading to false metrics around exposure.
   1. EarnOS only has verified humans as members on our platform. No bots.
