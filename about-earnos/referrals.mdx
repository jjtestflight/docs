How will the referral system work?

The EarnOS referral program is designed to encourage all EarnOS members to share the EarnOS experience with their friends and online network. Its purpose is to accelerate the growth of the platform, increase brand awareness and reward the members who help EarnOS grow on an ongoing basis.

Any member and/or creator can participate in the referral program. Partners can also participate.

The EarnOS referral system is designed to operate on a two tier basis.

The first tier is for any new EarnOS member who is attributed to the referring member.

Attribution occurs by any shared link using a generated code that links the EarnOS referring member to the shared link. It can also occur using a referral code entered manually at sign-up.

When a new user clicks on the link or enters the code, the referring member automatically is attached to the new EarnOS member and will earn a portion of EarnOS’s mission completion revenue every time that new user completes a mission. The amount will be a defined percentage of EarnOS Partner revenue and ongoing and will not be deducted from the user reward portion of the model.

The second tier is when a referred EarnOS member refers a new EarnOS Member. This is considered a Friend of a Friend. In this instance, the original EarnOS member will receive an additional portion of the EarnOS partner revenue. This will again be a defined percentage of the EarnOS partner revenue and will be ongoing and will not be deducted from the user reward portion.

**Example 1 - Typical Member:**

1. **Wayne** joins EarnOS, completes verification and completes his first mission. Earning himself a reward.
2. **Wayne** loves the platform and generates his referral link and shares it on WhatsApp with his mates so they too can complete some missions and earn rewards.
3. His friend, **Phil**, sees the link and checks it out.
4. **Phil** decides it looks amazing and joins EarnOS using the referral link Wayne provided.
5. **Phil** completes verification and completes his first mission. Earning himself a reward.
6. **Wayne** receives a referral payout which is a portion of the EarnOS fee that is charged to the Partner every time a mission is completed by **Phil.**
7. **Phil l**oves the platform just as Wayne did and decides to invite his mates.
8. His friend, **David**, see’s the link and checks it out.
9. **David** also decides to sign up and complete some missions. He is attributed to **Phil** as a Friend and to **Wayne** as a Friend of a Friend.
10. Both **Phil** & **Wayne** earn a portion of the EarnOS Partner fee for each and every mission David completes on the EarnOS platform.
11. This process applies to all people Wayne and Phil refer on an ongoing basis. \
     \
    In this example, typical EarnOS members are anticipated to earn an additional anywhere between an additional 100 and 1500 USD a month depending on how actively they promote EarnOS to their networks.

**Example 2 - Typical Creator:**

12. **Sophie** joins EarnOS, having heard about EarnOS and joining as a Creator, completes verification.
13. **Sophie** loves the platform and generates her referral link and shares it on her social platforms, where she enjoys a total reach of approximately **2.5 million followers**.
14. Her followers see the link and check it out.
15. Of her total followers, **5% (125,000)** see Sophie’s post and decide it looks amazing.
16. Of those, **1% (1,250)** join EarnOS using the referral link Sophie shared.
17. Those followers complete verification and complete their first mission. Earning themself a reward.
18. **Sophie** receives a referral payout which is a portion of the EarnOS fee that is charged to the Partner every time a mission is completed by **all 1,250 new EarnOS members as Friends.**
19. **Those new members** love the platform decide to invite their mates.
20. On average, each referred follower invites **5 of their mates. (1,250)**
21. **Sophie** will have an additional **6,250** EarnOS members attributed to her as Friends of Friends.
22. Sophie would have a total of **7,500** Friends and Friends of friends (Her community)
23. Both **Sophie** & **her loyal followers** earn a portion of the EarnOS Partner fee for each and every mission David completes on the EarnOS platform.

    In this example, assuming that:

    1. the average EarnOS member completes **10 missions a month**
    2. a payout per completed mission of just **$0.10 per friend**
    3. and **$0.10** per friend of a friend.

    Sophie would earn $7,500 in referral earnings per month from EarnOS.

    **This is $90,000 USD of earnings per year from sharing the EarnOS opportunity with her existing followers**
