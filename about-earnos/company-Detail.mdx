**UDC: User-driven Curation – People are back in control.** \
The ultimate in consumer choice when connecting with brands.

A paradigm shift in the way we engage with brands. Consumers are no longer at the mercy of platforms forcing us to look at what they want. Serving ads we typically don’t want, didn't ask for and do not appreciate.

At EarnOS, we, the consumers, chose. We decide and through individual curation we already have a marketplace that is interested in your product by the simple fact they chose to explore your brand/product over endless other choices. This means that, definitionaly we provide the most tailored customer profile possible. Out of countless missions, EarnOS members will do the missions they are interested in. This reduces wasted spend on a target market that will never purchase.

**CPR: Cost Per Result – Shift from Traditional Models**

Businesses can now adopt Cost Per Result (CPR) – to maximise marketing spend.

1. No-Risk Approach - EarnOS ensures no downside risk. Brands pay solely for outcomes, not clicks or impressions.
2. Value-Centric Focus - CPR shifts the paradigm – payment tied to action, not interaction.
3. Outcome-Driven Definition - Partners define success through task completion before spending.

Transition to CPR for impactful, outcome-based marketing.

### Experience Points Function

What is the intended function of experience points?

**What?**

EP points are a tool to drive:

1. Enjoyment
2. Engagement
3. Growth
4. Virality
5. Reactivation
6. Resolution
7. Competition

**How?**

EP points expand the rewards structure of the EarnOS platform to create additional incentives and build strong user behaviour.

- EP points can be rewarded alongside paid missions and for smaller tasks of EarnOS based missions.
- EP points can be rewarded upon mission completion in a tiered manner, rewarding early mission completions with more EP points to reward desired platform behaviour.
- Partners are issued EP points at a ratio of their Mission spend (eg 2 EP points to every $1). This allows the Partner to offer additional benefit to members aligned with their desired outcomes.
- EP points are associated with levels on the platform, the higher the level the more kudos, sense of accomplishment and recognition you receive within your various communities.
- EP points can be earned by members when they provide additional information about themselves for their profile on EarnOS. This allows more targeted missions in a manner that both preserves user privacy providing the most tailored customers to partner missions.
- EP points hold the promise of future value through the EARN token and its future launch.
- EP points can be rewarded to people who have completed a collection of missions or repeating missions as a bonus to reward loyalty and brand engagement.
- EP points will allow members priority access to new missions alongside other benefits such as boosted rewards and prizes across the platform.
- Partners can offer access to exclusive missions based on the number of EP points visible on a public leaderboard earned across their community.

### EARN Token Function

What is the intended function of the token?

EarnOS Token (EARN) will be used to augment the EP functions of the platform:

1. Provide early access to specific missions/tasks/communities/opportunities when members purchase and hold EARN.
2. Provide increased rewards for specific missions/tasks/communities/opportunities when members purchase and hold EARN.
3. Provide increased referral rewards when a defined number or value of tokens purchased and held by the referrer.
4. Complement and Expand the EP points program
5. Allow Partners to increase rewards with additional value
6. Incentivise growth funnels using EARN distribution for new members within specified timeframe and/or specified number of users.
7. Incentives referral program by qualifying for additional EARN tokens when referral milestones are reached.
8. Offer Bonus Rewards when members chose to receive rewards in EARN over USDC
