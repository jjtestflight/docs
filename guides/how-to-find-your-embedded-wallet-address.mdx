When creating an account, the EarnOS platform generates you a brand new Ethereum wallet address. This allows you to receive instant payouts for completing missions and referring other people. This is facilitated through our partner, [Privy](https://privy.io).

Whilst using EarnOS day-to-day, you will not need to be concerned with your wallet address. The platform is built in a way where the technical details of how payments are sent and received on the blockchain are abstracted away from you, to allow you to focus on finding new brands and building communities.

## Finding Your Address

1. **Login to EarnOS** - using the account you want to find the associated wallet address for.
2. **Go to your profile page** - via the menu that appears when hovering over your name/profile picture in the top right corner, then selecting "My Profile".
3. **Find your wallet address in the url** - now the last part of the url will be your wallet address.
